# Naming

I created this tool as a simple and efficient wrapper around SQLite, inspired by Taskwarrior’s "low-friction"
philosophy. The goal was to reduce complexity and make querying as smooth and effortless as possible.

The name needed to be concise, intuitive, and reflect the core purpose of the tool. I wanted it to convey
**low friction**, **efficiency**, and **simplicity**. After experimenting with various options, I settled on
**Zero Friction Query (ZFQ)**. This name is **descriptive**, **easy to remember**, and aligns perfectly with
the tool’s aim of providing a frictionless querying experience.

**ZFQ** was chosen for its clarity and simplicity, reflecting the tool’s core philosophy and ensuring that it
directly communicates its purpose.
