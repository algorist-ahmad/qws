# zql (Zero-Friction Query Language)

ZQL is a lightweight wrapper around SQLite designed to simplify querying and reduce friction. Its goal is to provide a intuitive interface for managing and querying data with minimal effort. Built for more efficient day-to-day querying and transactions in the command line, making it ideal for quick, repetitive tasks.

Inspired by Taskwarrior's "low-friction" philosophy and syntax.

## Naming

I created this tool as a simple and efficient wrapper around SQLite, inspired by Taskwarrior’s "low-friction"
philosophy. The goal was to reduce complexity and make querying as smooth and effortless as possible.

The name needed to be concise, intuitive, and reflect the core purpose of the tool. I wanted it to convey
**low friction**, **efficiency**, and **simplicity**. After experimenting with various options, I settled on
**Zero Friction Query (ZQL)**. This name is **descriptive**, **easy to remember** because of its similarity with 'SQL', and aligns perfectly with
the tool’s aim of providing a frictionless querying experience.

**ZQL** was chosen for its clarity and simplicity, reflecting the tool’s core philosophy and ensuring that it
directly communicates its purpose.
